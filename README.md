The goal is to extract article content from various websites, clean and preprocess the data, and then analyze the sentiment to classify whether the articles are positive, negative, or neutral.

Features:
Web Scraping: Extracts article content using Pythonâ€™s BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries.
Sentiment Analysis: Uses the SIA function from the VADER library to determine sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, and compound).
Data Cleaning: Preprocesses the scraped content to remove noise and normalize the text for accurate analysis.
Visualization: Provides graphical representations of sentiment distributions across different articles.
